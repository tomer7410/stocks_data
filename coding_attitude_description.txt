architecture attitude description:

my first attitude of the architecture was to compere the stock data between the cache resource and the db resource and return to the client.
 
the caching data would updated by consuming from topic and write the more updated records (between the current cache and the new kafka message)
the producing data will produce by fetching  the data from amazon cloud and json file and produce in once in 10 min or 3 hours respectively
.
eventually in real time, per client request the data should compered by the db and the redis caching, and it not so helpful.

i decided to compare between the entire resources per client request in real time
